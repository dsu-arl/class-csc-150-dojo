# Welcome to the CSC-150 Dojo!  
In this dojo, you will learn all about the C programming language!  

If you don't have experience with the pwn.college platform and/or with Linux, you will want to do the Using the Dojo and Linux Basics modules first!

"Using the Dojo" is imported from the pwn.college homepage (created by ASU).
All other content in this dojo was created by Dakota State University.
