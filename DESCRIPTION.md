# Welcome to the CSC-150 Dojo!  
In this dojo, you will learn all about the C programming language!  

## What is Programming?  
Programs are a set of instructions that allow computers to perform specific tasks. These instructions, written by humans, are designed to be readable and understandable. Computers then translate and execute these programs, enabling programmers to solve real-world problems.  

## C Programming  
There are many different programming languages — you can even design your own! The C programming language, created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs, remains one of the most widely used languages in the computer science industry. Although it’s been around for decades, C is a great starting point for learning programming fundamentals. The programming concepts covered in this dojo — variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc. — also apply to most other programming languages.  


C is a **compiled language**, which means the computer translates human-written programs into machine-readable instructions, resulting in an **executable** program that can be run. C provides the programmer with **low-level memory access**, which grants control over the computer's memory. However, with great power comes great responsibility! Incorrect use of memory can break your program or, in extreme cases, even affect the stability of your computer.


If you don't have experience with the pwn.college platform and/or with Linux, you will want to do the Start Here and Linux Basics modules first!
